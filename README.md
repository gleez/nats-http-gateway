# nats-http-gateway

This is an open-source alternative to the Synadia Cloud's HTTP Gateway, offering a first-class HTTP interface for NATS. It provides HTTP access to NATS capabilities such as key-value stores, object storage, messaging, and services, making NATS even more accessible for developers familiar with HTTP.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress and currently does not provide any authentication mechanisms. Please use at your own risk.

For reference and detailed documentation, check out the [Synadia Cloud HTTP Gateway documentation](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/resources/http-gateway).
